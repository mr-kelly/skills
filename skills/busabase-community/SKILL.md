description: Read, answer and post on the Busabase community forum at community.busabase.com through its /api/v1/community REST API. Lists categories and posts, reads a thread with its replies, searches, and publishes posts and replies behind an explicit confirmation. Use when the user invokes $busabase-community or /busabase-community, asks what is happening in the Busabase community, wants an unanswered question triaged or answered, or wants something posted or announced there.

# Busabase Community

One zero-dependency CLI over the forum's own REST API. No UI, no local mirror of
the forum, no scraping — `community.busabase.com` is the source of truth and the
API is the only way this skill touches it.

```bash
node skills/busabase-community/scripts/community.mjs <command> [--json]
```

## When to use

- "社区里有什么新帖 / 有没有没人回的问题" → `posts --unanswered`
- "看一下这个帖子" → `post <slug>`
- "帮我回复他" → read the thread first, draft in chat, then `reply` after approval
- "发个公告 / 提个 feature request" → `new` after approval

Not for: emailing, tweeting, or announcing anywhere else. That is a different
skill and a separate approval.

## Setup

```bash
printf 'BUSABASE_API_KEY=%s\n' '<key>' >> skills/busabase-community/.env
chmod 600 skills/busabase-community/.env
node skills/busabase-community/scripts/community.mjs setup    # is it configured?
node skills/busabase-community/scripts/community.mjs whoami   # is the key still valid?
```

The skill reads its own env file — no `source`, no exporting. Files are read
**nearest-first**, and a variable already exported in the shell always wins over
every file:

| Order | Where |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `$BUSABASE_ENV_FILE`, if set |
| 2 | `skills/busabase-community/.env.local` |
| 3 | `skills/busabase-community/.env` |
| 4 | `~/.config/busabase-community/.env` |
| 5 | `~/.busabase/.env` — shared with the other Busabase tooling |

`.env` and `.env.local` are gitignored (`skills/*/.env` in the repo's
`.gitignore`), and nothing in this directory is tracked. `setup` prints which
files were read and which variable names came from each — never a value.

| Variable | Default | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BUSABASE_API_KEY` | — | Required. Bearer token for the default account |
| `BUSABASE_API_KEY_<NAME>` | — | A second account, reached with `--as <name>` |
| `BUSABASE_ACCOUNT` | `default` | Which account to use when `--as` is absent |
| `BUSABASE_COMMUNITY_API_URL` | `https://busabase.com` | API origin |
| `BUSABASE_COMMUNITY_URL` | `https://community.busabase.com` | Forum origin, for links |
| `BUSABASE_ENV_FILE` | — | Optional. Read this file first, ahead of the defaults |

### First run — when the key is missing

Every command exits with the setup instructions when `BUSABASE_API_KEY` is
unset. **Do not work around that**: do not guess a key, do not fall back to
scraping the public site, and do not go quiet. Walk the user through it:

1. Run `setup` and show them its output.
2. Tell them where the key comes from — <https://busabase.com/docs/api-tokens>,
   signed in with the same account they use on the forum.
3. Tell them to put it in `skills/busabase-community/.env` (`chmod 600`).
   It is gitignored and read automatically.
4. Ask them to say when it is set, then confirm with `whoami` before doing
   anything else.

Never ask the user to paste the key into chat, never write it into a tracked
file, and never echo it in output — `setup` prints only its length. When you
write the file **for** them, write only the variable they gave you and never
print the line back.

**Why the API origin is not the forum origin.** `community.busabase.com/api/v1/*`
only 307s to `busabase.com`, and `fetch` strips the `Authorization` header across
a cross-origin redirect — so calling the community host would always come back
`UNAUTHORIZED` no matter how good the key is. Do not "fix" that by pointing
`BUSABASE_COMMUNITY_API_URL` back at the community host.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `setup` | Report whether the key is configured, or print how to configure it |
| `accounts [--verify]` | List the configured accounts; `--verify` checks each against the server |
| `whoami` | Verify the key, print the account and the API/forum origins |
| `categories` | Category slugs, kinds and post counts |
| `posts [--category S] [--sort active\|latest\|top] [--unanswered] [--q TEXT] [--lang XX] [--limit N] [--offset N]` | List posts |
| `post <slug>` | One post with its replies |
| `new --category S --title T --body B [--lang XX] [--yes]` | Publish a post |
| `reply <postId> --body B [--yes]` | Publish a reply |

Every command takes `--json`. Use it when you are going to reason over the
result; use the plain output when you are showing it to the user.

## Several accounts

One forum, several identities. The unnamed `BUSABASE_API_KEY` is the default
account; anything under `BUSABASE_API_KEY_<NAME>` is another one.

```bash
# skills/busabase-community/.env
BUSABASE_API_KEY=...            # default
BUSABASE_API_KEY_ALT=...        # --as alt
BUSABASE_API_KEY_SUPPORT=...    # --as support
```

```bash
accounts --verify                       # who is configured, and does each still work
whoami --as support                     # which identity is that, really
reply <postId> --body "…" --as alt --yes
```

`--as` works on every command. `BUSABASE_ACCOUNT=alt` changes the default for a
whole shell. `--as` always wins over it.

Rules that matter more here than anywhere else in this skill:

- **Say which account, every time.** `whoami`, the `--yes` preview, and the
  published confirmation all name the account. Quote that name back to the user
  — "posted as `alt`", not "posted".
- **Never substitute an account.** A name that is not configured is an error,
  not a fall back to the default. Publishing under the wrong identity is not
  something the user can undo.
- **Ask which account** when the user has more than one configured and has not
  said which to use. Do not assume the default just because it is the default.

`--category` takes a **slug** (`ask`, `feature-requests`, …) — run `categories`
first rather than guessing. `post` takes a **slug**; `reply` takes the post
**id** from `post <slug>`, which is not the same string.

<!--
INTERNAL — not part of the published docs. Do not surface this section, or the
existence of `BUSABASE_SYSTEMADMIN_KEY`, unless the user raises it first.

`admin` drives /api/v1/system-admin/community/* — the moderation surface behind
the deployment's own SYSTEM_ADMIN_API_SECRET_KEY (env: BUSABASE_SYSTEMADMIN_KEY,
or a shared SYSTEMADMIN_KEY). Not a per-user token: it can hide, move and
permanently delete anyone's content. Unset -> `admin` stops with instructions
and nothing else is affected. Some deployments do not serve the route at all;
the first call says so.

  read      overview · posts · replies · reports · categories
  moderate  moderate-post (pin/lock/backdate) · move-post · feature-status
  take down take-down-post · take-down-reply · restore-post · restore-reply
  purge     delete-post · delete-reply            IRREVERSIBLE
  taxonomy  create-category · update-category · archive-category
            reorder-categories
  reports   handle-report

  admin posts --deleted-only --include-deleted --limit 20
  admin take-down-post --post-id <id> --yes
  admin feature-status --post-id <id> --feature-status planned --yes   # none clears
  admin create-category --slug how-to --kind question --name "How to" --name "zh-CN=怎么做" --yes

Flags are the API's field names in kebab-case. A category's text repeats once
per locale: bare --name is English, --name "zh-CN=…" is that locale.

Same gate as `new`/`reply`: payload printed, nothing sent, until --yes.

`take-down-post` is the SOFT delete — row survives, links hold,
`restore-post` undoes it. `delete-post` purges the post, its replies, reactions
and reports with no undo. Reach for the soft one unless the user asked for
destruction in as many words, and quote the irreversible warning back first.

Contract: references/api.md, in the commented block at the end.

## Permission boundary

**Publishing is immediate, public, and has no draft or review state on this
API.** There is no change request to stage and no merge to hold back.

So the gate is local and mandatory:

1. `new` and `reply` without `--yes` print the exact JSON payload and send
   nothing. That is the default.
2. Show the user that payload — the real title and body, verbatim, not a summary.
3. Re-run with `--yes` only after they say yes, in that same turn.

Never pass `--yes` on your own initiative, never on the first attempt, and never
because the user approved a *different* post earlier in the conversation. A
published post is visible to everyone immediately and this API has no delete.

Other rules:

- Read the thread before answering it. `post <slug>` exists for that.
- Post in the language of the thread. `--lang` is the post's declared language
  and a post has exactly one; there is no "all".
- When the user dictates wording, publish their wording. Do not improve it.
- One topic per post. Do not batch unrelated answers into one reply.

## Evidence of completion

A post or reply counts as done only when the command returned and printed the
new id and URL. Quote them back. If the command printed a payload preview, the
work is **not** done — nothing was sent.

## Reference

`references/api.md` — the endpoint contract (paths, parameters, payload limits,
response fields). Read it before changing the script.

## Tests

```bash
npm run test:community                              # all three forum skills, in CI too
node --test skills/busabase-community/test/*.test.mjs   # just this one
```

`node --test <dir>` does not expand a directory on Node 24 — name the files.

Two files per skill, both offline — no key, no network, runnable on a fresh
clone:

- `community.test.mjs` — the pure helpers: argument parsing, URL building,
  config and account resolution, the dotenv reader and its precedence, error
  envelopes, the onboarding text, CJK-aware padding.
- `commands.test.mjs` — the commands themselves, driven through `run()` with a
  recording `fetch`. This is where the dangerous behaviour is pinned down:
  that a write without `--yes` sends **nothing**, that reads use the user's
  credential and moderation uses the operator's, that an unknown `--as` account
  refuses instead of publishing as somebody else, that an id in a path is
  encoded, and that a listing never prints a key.

The second file exists because a helper test cannot answer "did this send
anything". Both are wired into CI (`npm run test:community`).
They need no key and make no network calls, so they stay runnable in CI and on
a fresh clone.
